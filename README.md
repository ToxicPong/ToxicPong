She like, "Ain't you Ken Car$on? Ainâ€™t you Teen X?"
"Can you call your partner up for me? Ask where them beans at"
I told that bitch I love her but I really did not mean it
My jeans, they Undercover and I'm rockin' a Blackmeans jacket
And my shoes, they undiscovered, bitch, you cannot find where these at
He wanna swag like me, yeah, he wanna be like Teen X
He wanna be like Teen Bean, now he pourinâ€™ up lean and he rollin' up weed
Bought a Teen X hoodie and a Teen X tee
GivĞµ a fuck 'bout that shit, you will never be mĞµ

I go get some money and fuck on a freak
But her friend coming home so I gotta retreat
But I still got the top so it's mission complete
I just fuck on that bitch then I block and delete her
Might want her for the night but I do not need her
I'm countin' up Franklins, ain't talkin' Aretha
Iâ€™m pourinâ€™ up drank and I'm rollinâ€™ some weed up
I feel like a boss, I'm kickin' my feet up
If you don't wanna shoot, then you can get beat up
Got my gun and my shooter, my handâ€™ll spray too
I'm in the mosh pit, punching your crew
It ain't nowhere to go, he don't know what to do
I'm tweetin' on Twitter, I'm going up, ooh
I'm all on Instagram, I'm going up too
She love my aesthetic, she say that I'm cool
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I'm breaking the rules

I don't give a fuck, bitch, I'm breaking the rules
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I'm breaking the rules
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I'm breaking the rules
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I'm breaking the rules

I don't move how you want me to move
I don't do what you want me to do
I do what I want, I do what I please
I don't do this for you, bitch, I do it for me
What I do for you, you wouldn't do it for me
I look out for you like an owl in a tree
I feel like a butterfly, I sting like a bee
I feel like the greatest, Muhammad Ali
I'm first and you last, like A and Z
Anything that I do, they pay me a fee
I'm countin' the the blues, I'm countin' the green
Every where that I go, they like, "Ayy, that's Teen Bean"
Bitch, I'm Ken Car$on, ecstasy teen
Your bitch a fan, yeah, she a fiend
We at my hotel, I'm breakin' her spleen
I'm breaking the rules, give a fuck what you think

I don't give a fuck, bitch, I'm breaking the rules
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I'm breaking the rules
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I'm breaking the rules
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I'm breaking the rules
